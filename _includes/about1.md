<a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/"><img src="/img/logo-polymer.png" style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px"></a>I still consider programming my main interest, although after a 30 year streak, euphoria comes and goes. [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org) and [Web components](http://webcomponents.org/) has made the scene a lot more fun. Polymer and its [Paper Elements](https://elements.polymer-project.org/browse?package=paper-elements), being Google's reference implementation of their ground-breaking [Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html), doesn't make it any less interesting. I believe this to be paradigm shifting. Let's see how it all will relate to [Angular](https://angular.io/) in the future.
