Making music (or at least sounds) with [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live) is something I have done from time to time during the past 10years or so. This wonderful world of [VSTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Studio_Technology) never stops to amaze me. Synths like [Serum](https://www.xferrecords.com/products/serum), [Spire](http://reveal-sound.com/) and [Diversion](http://dmitrysches.com/diversion), to name a few, are an endless  source of timbral inspiration, as they support several [synthesis methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Sound_synthesis_types). I have to admit that I rarely get passed making sequences &mdash; always seem to get stuck in the sonic swamp <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>. Hopefully I will someday post something on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/4myle).
