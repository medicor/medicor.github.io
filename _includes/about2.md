Making music (or at least sounds) with [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live) is something I have done from time to time during the past 10years or so. This wonderful world of [VSTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Studio_Technology) never stops to amaze me. Synths like Serum, Spire and Diversion are an endless  source of timbral inspiration, since they all can be considered multi-synthesis - VA, FM, wavetable, granular. I have to admit that I rarely get passed producing sequnces, getting stuck in the sonic swamp <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>.
