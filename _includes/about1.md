I still consider programming my main interest, although after a 30 year streak, euphoria comes and goes. [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org) and [Web components](http://webcomponents.org/) has made the scene a lot more fun lately. Polymer and its [Paper Elements](https://elements.polymer-project.org/browse?package=paper-elements), being Google's reference implementation of their beautiful [Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html), is the other half that makes this interesting. I believe this all to be paradigm shifting. Let's see how it will relate to [Angular](https://angular.io/) in the future.
