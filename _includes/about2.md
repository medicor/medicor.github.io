Making sounds with [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live) is something I have done from time to time during the past 10 years or so. The world of [VSTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Studio_Technology) never stops to amaze me. Synths like [Serum](https://www.xferrecords.com/products/serum), [Spire](http://reveal-sound.com/) and [Diversion](http://dmitrysches.com/diversion), to name a few, are an endless  source of timbral inspiration. I have to admit that I rarely get passed making sequences &mdash; always seem to get stuck in the sonic swamp. Hopefully I will someday post something on my [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/4myle) that isn't private.
