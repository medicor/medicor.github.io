Trading with technical analysis as a foundation is fun and (sometimes) profitable. I started out about three years before the [dotcom bubble](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dotcom-bubble.asp) collapsed and have, despite that, continued since. Back then, [Metastock](http://www.metastock.com/) was the tool for us amateurs, today I use the excellent [Tradingview](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/eO0kdePX/) and also having fun with the crowd-sourced [Estimize](https://www.estimize.com/users/analyst_9514914). Nowadays I mostly trade bull certificates on US and Chineese tech companies.
