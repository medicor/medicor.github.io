I still consider programming my main interest, although after a 30 year streak, euphoria comes and goes. [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org) and [Web components](http://webcomponents.org/) has made the scene a lot more fun lately. [Paper Elements](https://elements.polymer-project.org/browse?package=paper-elements), being Google's reference implementation of their beautiful [Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html), is the other half of my two-folded interest. [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) as backend and for hosting, together with Polymer, makes an exciting backend-less solution and is my stack of choice.
